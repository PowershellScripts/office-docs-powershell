# Get-CsUserPolicyAssignment

## SYNOPSIS
NOTE: This cmdlet is currently only available in limited preview in the pre-release Teams PowerShell module.

This cmdlet is used to return the policy assignments for a user, both directly assigned and inherited from a group.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-CsUserPolicyAssignment -Identity <String> [-PolicyType <String>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlets returns the effective policies for a user, based on either direct policy assignment or inheritance from a group policy assignment.  For a given policy type, if an effective policy is not returned, this indicates that the effective policy for the user is either the tenant global default policy (if set) or the system global default policy.

This cmdlet does not currently support returning policies for multiple users.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
This examples returns the policies that are either directly assigned to a user or that the user inherited from a group.

```
Get-CsUserPolicyAssignment -Identity 3b90faad-9056-49ff-8357-0b53b1d45d39

PolicyName            PolicyType
----------            ----------
AllowCalling          TeamsCallingPolicy
Employees Events      TeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy
Kiosk                 TeamsMeetingPolicy
```

### Example 2
The PolicySource property can be expanded to show  more details for a particular policy type.  The PolicySource property indicates whether a particular policy was directly assigned to the user or inherited from a group.

In this example, the details for the TeamsBroadcastMeetingPolicy are shown. The user was directly assigned the "Employees Events" policy, which took precedence over the "Vendor Live Events" policy which is assigned to a group that the user belongs to.

```
Get-CsUserPolicyAssignment -Identity 3b90faad-9056-49ff-8357-0b53b1d45d39 -PolicyType TeamsMeetingBroadcastPolicy | select -ExpandProperty PolicySource

AssignmentType PolicyName         Reference
-------------- ----------         ---------
Direct         Employees Events
Group          Vendor Live Events 566b8d39-5c5c-4aaa-bc07-4f36278a1b38
```

### Example 3
In this example, the details for the TeamsMeetingPolicy are shown. The user is a member of two groups, each of which is assigned a TeamsMeetingPolicy.  The user has inherited the "AllOn" policy because the priority of the assignment is higher than that of the "Kiosk" policy assignment to the other group.

```
Get-CsUserPolicyAssignment -Identity 3b90faad-9056-49ff-8357-0b53b1d45d39 -PolicyType TeamsMeetingPolicy | select -ExpandProperty PolicySource
